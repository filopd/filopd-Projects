Exercise 1.1 Although the NSFG has been conducted seven times, it is not a longitudinal study.

	http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-sectional_study
	http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitudinal_study
	Ans: Longitudinal studies track the same people.

Exercise 1.2 Download data from the NSFG
	Go to http://thinkstats.com/nsfg.html
	Read the terms of use for this data and click “I accept these terms”
	Download the ﬁles named 2002FemResp.dat.gz and 2002FemPreg.dat.gz
	http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/nsfg6 Browse the sections in the left navigation bar to get a sense of what data are included.

Program:
	Download http://thinkstats.com/survey.py
	Op:	Number of respondents 7643
	Op:	Number of pregnancies 13593
	Browse the code to get a sense of what it does.
	Ans: After adding all the zip files and python file into a directory, open this survey.py in PyCharm, put a break point in main method and go through the flow.

Exercise 1.3 In this exercise you will write a program to explore the data in the Pregnancies table.
	1. In the directory where you put survey.py and the data ﬁles, create a ﬁle named first.py and type or paste in the following code:
		import survey
		table = survey.Pregnancies()
		table.ReadRecords()
		print('Number of pregnancies', len(table.records))
		Op: Number of pregnancies 13593

	2. Write a loop that iterates table and counts the number of live births. Find the documentation of outcome and conﬁrm that your result is consistent with the summary in the documentation.
	Op: Count of Live Births is: 9148

	3. Modify the loop to partition the live birth records into two groups, one for ﬁrst babies and one for the others. Again, read the documentation of birthord to see if your results are consistent.
	Op:	Count of First Baby is: 4413
		Count of other than First Baby is: 4735

	4. Compute the average pregnancy length (in weeks) for ﬁrst babies and others. Is there a difference between the groups? How big is it?
	Op:	Average of Pregnancy length of all First Babies in weeks is: 38.60095173351461
		Average of Pregnancy length of all other than First Baby in weeks is: 38.52291446673706
